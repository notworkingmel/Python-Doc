        <header>Introduction to Python</header>
        <p class="paragraph">Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Due to its versatility and ease of use, Python is widely adopted in areas like web development, data science, machine learning, and automation.</p>
        <code><p class="code grey-text"># Simple Python program to print a greeting</p>
          <p class="code">def greet(name):</p>
          <p class="code sangria">print(f"Hello, {name}!")</p>

        <p class="sub-title"><strong>Key Features of Python</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Python’s <strong>syntax is designed to be simple and clear</strong>, making it easy for both beginners and experts to write and read code. This reduces the learning curve and helps developers be more productive.</li>
          <li>Being <strong>cross-platform</strong>, Python can run on various operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux. This allows developers to write code that works seamlessly across different environments.</li>
          <li>As an <strong>interpreted language</strong> , Python executes code line-by-line, which makes it easier to debug programs as errors are identified one step at a time.</li>
          <li>Python is <strong>dynamically typed</strong>, meaning you don’t need to declare variable types explicitly, as the interpreter infers them at runtime. This gives flexibility but requires careful coding to avoid type errors.</li>
          <li>Python includes a <strong>large standard library</strong> that provides modules and functions to handle common tasks like file handling, regular expressions, and data manipulation. This eliminates the need for external dependencies for many common tasks.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Types_in_Python">
        <header>Data Types in Python</header>
        <p class="paragraph">Python has several built-in data types that help store and manipulate data in different forms. The most common types include integers, floats, strings, and booleans. Understanding data types is essential for writing effective Python programs, as they define what operations can be performed on the data.</p>
        <code><p class="code grey-text"># Different data types in Python</p>
          <p class="code same-line">x = 10</p><p class="code grey-text same-line sangria"># int</p>
          <p class="code same-line">y = 3.14</p><p class="code grey-text same-line sangria"># float</p>
          <p class="code same-line">z = "Hello"</p><p class="code grey-text same-line sangria"># string</p>
          <p class="code same-line">flag = True</p><p class="code grey-text same-line sangria"># boolean</p>
        </code>
        <p class="sub-title"><strong>Detailed Information on Python Data Types:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Integer (int):</strong> Represents whole numbers, both positive and negative. For example, x = 5 assigns an integer value of 5. Python allows mathematical operations on integers, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.</li>
          <li><strong>Floating-point number (float):</strong>Represents real numbers that include a decimal point. For instance, y = 3.14 stores a floating-point value. This type is useful for precise calculations but may involve rounding errors due to how floats are stored in memory.</li>
          <li><strong>String (str):</strong> A string is a sequence of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes. Strings in Python are immutable, meaning their content cannot be changed after creation. Operations such as concatenation (+) and slicing ([]) are often performed on strings..</li>
          <li><strong>Boolean (bool):</strong> Booleans represent the truth values True and False, which are useful in conditional statements to control program logic. Boolean values can result from comparisons, such as flag = (5 > 3), which would set flag to True.</li>
          <li><strong>Lists</strong> and <strong>tuples</strong> are collections of items. Lists are mutable, allowing modifications, while tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot change. These are useful for grouping related data.</li>
          <li><strong>Dictionaries</strong> store data as key-value pairs, offering fast lookup times when retrieving information based on keys.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Control_Flow">
        <header>Control Flow</header>
        <p class="paragraph">Control flow statements in Python dictate the sequence in which code is executed. These statements, including conditional blocks (if, else, elif) and loops (for, while), are fundamental for directing logic and managing repetitive tasks.</p>
        <code><p class="code grey-text"># Example of control flow with if-else</p>
          <p class="code">num = 10</p>
          <p class="code">if num > 5:</p>
          <p class="code sangria">print("The number is greater than 5")</p>
          <p class="code">else:</p>
          <p class="code sangria">print("The number is less than or equal to 5")</p>
        </code>
        <p class="sub-title"><strong>Further Explanation of Control Flow Mechanisms:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>if statement:</strong> This statement checks whether a condition is true and executes the associated block of code if it is. For example, if x > 0: would check if x is positive and run the block under it.</li>
          <li><strong>else statement:</strong>Provides an alternative block to execute when the if condition is false. This ensures that some code runs regardless of whether the initial condition holds.</li>
          <li><strong>elif statement:</strong> Short for "else if," this allows for multiple conditions to be checked in sequence. If the first condition is false, it checks the next, and so on.</li>
          <li><strong>for loop:</strong> Used to iterate over a sequence, such as a list, tuple, or string. Each iteration processes one item from the sequence. For instance, for i in range(3): would execute the loop body three times.</li>
          <li><strong>while loop:</strong> Continues executing as long as a specified condition is true. It’s ideal for situations where the number of iterations isn't known beforehand but depends on some runtime condition.</li>
          <li><strong>break statement:</strong> Exits the loop prematurely when a condition is met, while continue skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves to the next.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
        <p class="paragraph">Functions are reusable blocks of code that allow developers to break programs into smaller, manageable pieces. Functions in Python are defined with the def keyword, followed by the function name and parameters. They help reduce redundancy and improve code organization.</p>
        <code><p class="grey-text code"># Function that calculates the square of a number</p>
          <p class="code">def square(x):</p>
          <p class="sangria code">return x ** 2</p>
          <p class="code same-line">print(square(5))</p><p class="grey-text same-line code sangria"># Output: 25</p>
        </code>
        <p class="sub-title"><strong>Deeper Dive into Functions:</strong></p>
        <p>To define a function, use the def keyword. A function can take any number of parameters and can return a result using the return statement. For instance, def add(a, b): return a + b defines a function to add two numbers.</p>
        <p>Parameters act as placeholders for values passed into the function, enabling dynamic and reusable functions. When there is no return statement, the function will return None by default. Functions can also have default parameter values, which are used if no arguments are passed. Additionally, keyword arguments allow passing arguments by specifying parameter names, offering more flexibility in function calls.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Working_with_Lists">
        <header>Working with Lists</header>
        <p class="paragraph">Lists in Python are one of the most flexible and powerful data structures. They allow developers to store ordered collections of items, and since they are mutable, their elements can be modified after creation. Lists are widely used due to their versatility.</p>
        <code><p class="code grey-text"># Example of working with a list</p>
          <p class="code">fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]</p>
          <p class="code">fruits.append("orange")</p>
          <p class="code same-line">print(fruits)</p>
          <p class="code same-line grey-text"># Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'orange']</p>
        </code>
        <p class="paragraph">Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be changed, added, or removed after creation. For example, fruits[0] = "pear" changes the first element from "apple" to "pear". The append() method adds an element to the end of the list, while extend() can add multiple elements at once.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Elements can be removed using remove(), which deletes the first occurrence of a specified value, or pop(), which removes an element by its index and returns it. Lists can be sliced to access subsets of elements using the format list[start:end], creating a new list with selected elements. The len() function returns the number of elements in the list, which is useful for counting items or iterating through all elements in loops.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Error_Handling">
        <header>Error Handling</header>
        <p class="paragraph">Error handling in Python is managed through the try and except blocks. These blocks allow developers to anticipate and manage exceptions (errors that occur during runtime) to prevent program crashes. Python provides various exception types, such as ValueError, TypeError, and ZeroDivisionError, which can be caught and handled gracefully.</p>
        <code><p class="code grey-text"># Example of error handling using try-except</p>
          <p class="code">try:</p>
          <p class="code sangria">result = 10 / 0</p>
          <p class="code">except ZeroDivisionError:</p>
          <p class="code sangria">print("Cannot divide by zero!")</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="File_Handling">
        <header>File Handling</header>
        <p class="paragraph">Python makes file handling easy with built-in functions that allow reading from and writing to files. Files can be opened in various modes, such as read (r), write (w), append (a), or a combination of these. This is particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of data or persistent storage.</p>
        <code><p class="code grey-text"># Example of writing to a file</p>
          <p class="code">with open("example.txt", "w") as file:</p>
          <p class="code sangria">file.write("Hello, World!")</p>
          
          <p class="code grey-text"># Example of reading from a file</p>
          <p class="code">with open("example.txt", "r") as file:</p>
          <p class="code sangria">content = file.read()</p>
          <p class="code sangria">print(content)</p>
        </code>
        <p class="paragraph">To open a file, the open() function is used, which returns a file object. Files can be opened in different modes, such as "r" for reading, "w" for writing (which overwrites the file if it exists), and "a" for appending data to the file. The with statement is commonly used in file handling as it ensures the file is properly closed after the block is executed, even if exceptions occur. Reading from a file can be done using methods like read(), which reads the entire content, or readline(), which reads one line at a time.</p>
